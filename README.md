# Trustless-Escrow
Solidity implementation of a trustless escrow.

Trustless escrow using dual party deposits to facilitate the "trustless" aspect. 
Users must manually check if the other party has made deposits.
Deposits returned to parties once transaction is inactive (either completed or cancelled).
Preliminary testing done.

To Do: Automate checks, implement restrictions, self-destruct once transaction is inactive.
